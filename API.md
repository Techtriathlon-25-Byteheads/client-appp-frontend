## Real-time System (WebSockets)

The system provides real-time queue updates and appointment booking using WebSockets via the Socket.IO library.

### Connection

Clients should connect to the root of the server URL.

**Example (Client-side JavaScript):**

```javascript
import { io } from "socket.io-client";

const socket = io("http://localhost:3000", {
  auth: {
    token: "<your_jwt_token>" // See Authentication section
  }
});

socket.on("connect", () => {
  console.log("Connected to the server!", socket.id);
});

socket.on("disconnect", () => {
  console.log("Disconnected from the server.");
});
```

### Authentication

The WebSocket connection is authenticated using the same JWT token as the REST API. The token **must** be passed in the `auth.token` field during the initial connection setup.

If the token is missing or invalid, the server will refuse the connection.

### Events

The following section details the events you can use to interact with the real-time system.

#### `emit`: Client-to-Server Events

These are events that the client application should emit to the server.

**1. `join_service_queue`**

Joins a room to receive real-time updates for a specific service queue. The client should emit this event when a user views a service they might book an appointment for.

*   **Payload:** `string` - The `serviceId` of the queue to watch.
*   **Example:**
    ```javascript
    socket.emit('join_service_queue', 'SER1723532294023');
    ```

**2. `book_appointment`**

Books a new appointment. This is the real-time equivalent of the `POST /appointments` REST endpoint.

*   **Payload:** `object` - The appointment details.
*   **Payload Structure:**
    ```json
    {
        "departmentId": "DEP1723532294023",
        "serviceId": "SER1723532294023",
        "appointmentDate": "2025-12-25", // Format: YYYY-MM-DD
        "appointmentTime": "10:00",      // Format: HH:MM
        "notes": "I need this urgently."
    }
    ```
*   **Example:**
    ```javascript
    const appointmentDetails = { /* ...payload structure... */ };
    socket.emit('book_appointment', appointmentDetails);
    ```

#### `on`: Server-to-Client Events

These are events that the client application should listen for.

**1. `queue_update`**

Provides the current queue size for a service. This is sent immediately after a client joins a service queue and is broadcast to all clients in that queue's room whenever a new appointment is booked.

*   **Payload:** `object`
*   **Payload Structure:**
    ```json
    {
        "serviceId": "SER1723532294023",
        "queueCount": 5
    }
    ```
*   **Example:**
    ```javascript
    socket.on('queue_update', (data) => {
      console.log(`Queue for service ${data.serviceId} is now ${data.queueCount}`);
      // Update UI here
    });
    ```

**2. `appointment_booked`**

Confirms to the originating user that their appointment was successfully created. The payload is the full appointment object.

*   **Payload:** `Appointment Object` (See structure in REST API docs)
*   **Example:**
    ```javascript
    socket.on('appointment_booked', (appointment) => {
      console.log('Appointment successfully booked:', appointment);
      // Navigate to confirmation page
    });
    ```

**3. `admin_queue_update` (Admins Only)**

Sent only to authenticated admin/superadmin clients. This event fires whenever *any* service queue changes, allowing for a real-time dashboard view of the entire system.

*   **Payload:** `object`
*   **Payload Structure:**
    ```json
    {
        "serviceId": "SER1723532294023",
        "queueCount": 6
    }
    ```
*   **Example:**
    ```javascript
    socket.on('admin_queue_update', (data) => {
      console.log(`ADMIN VIEW: Queue for ${data.serviceId} is now ${data.queueCount}`);
      // Update admin dashboard UI
    });
    ```

**4. `error`**

Sent by the server if an operation fails (e.g., invalid data for booking, authentication error).

*   **Payload:** `object`
*   **Payload Structure:**
    ```json
    {
        "message": "This time slot is full."
    }
    ```
*   **Example:**
    ```javascript
    socket.on('error', (error) => {
      console.error('An error occurred:', error.message);
      // Show an error message to the user
    });
    ```
