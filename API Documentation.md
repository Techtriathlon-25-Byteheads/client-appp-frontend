# API Documentation

## Local Setup (Docker)

The entire backend system, including the database, is containerized with Docker and can be run with a single command. This is the recommended way to run the application for local development.

*Prerequisites:*

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### 1. Configure Environment

First, create a .env file for your local environment variables. You can copy the provided example file:

bash
cp .env.example .env

Next, open the .env file and change the values for JWT_SECRET and ENCRYPTION_KEY to your own long, random, secret strings.

### 2. Build and Run

Use Docker Compose to build the API image and start both the API and PostgreSQL containers.

bash
docker-compose up --build

This command will:

- Build the Docker image for the API.
- Start the API and database containers.
- Automatically apply all Prisma database migrations.
- Seed the database with a default super admin user.

The API will be available at <http://localhost:3000>.

### Default Super Admin Credentials

- *Email:* <superadmin@gov.lk>
- *Password:* password123

  auth: {
    token: "<your_jwt_token>"
